<h1> CODING CHALLANGE </h1>

<h2>Description </h2>
<p>In this project, I am going to solve 3 different coding situations presented to me. In the situations I will get to use selection statements such as if else statements and repitition statement (looping) eg for loops, while loops and do while loops. All of my solutions are only in JavaScript</p>

<h2>Project Setup </h2> 
<h3>Student Grade Generator</h3>
<p>This challenge has been solved in the index.js file.I have solved it using JavaScript.In this challange, I have used if else statements to represent the different ranges that the grading system has. There are 5 ranges thus I have used 5 if else statements.Everything has been enclosed in a function</p>
<h3>Speed Detector</h3>
<p>This challenged has been solved in the speed.js file. I created a function and inside the it I used a combination of if else statements and for loops. the for loop has been nested in the if else statement </p>
<h3>Net Salary Calculator</h3>
<p>Solution located in the salary.js file.Firstly I created a function. In it, i used if else statements to calculate the PAYE and the NHIF deductions.Also, I used arithmetic operations to find the gross salary and the net salary</p>
